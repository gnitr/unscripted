Phase 1

[DONE] Django project and apps skeletons
[DONE] Rewrite models with MongoDB bue to Thing inheritence and flexible schema
[DONE] Dummy models for
    . Thing
    . World
    . Bot
. Web api framework:
    [DONE] create a world        POST /worlds
    [DONE] list words            GET /worlds
    [DONE] remove a world        DEL /worlds/X
    [DONE] create a bot          POST /worlds/X/bots
    [DONE] things in a world     GET /worlds/X/things
    [DONE] move bot              POST /things/Y/actions/walk/X?angle=0.3
    [DONE] change parentid to objectid
    [DONE] use y has real height from ground 
. Crude visualisation
    [DONE] web page
    [DONE] get world data with web api
    . improve the low perf, 50% cpu on i7 for an empty map is prohibitive
    [DONE] very basic visualisation of bots on world map
    . camera:
        () add ability to move the camera (not just rotate and zoom)
        () rotate camera around itself
        [DONE] prevent camera to show reverse of ground
        . remember the last camera settings
        . follow bot mode
    [DONE] click on a bot
    . better colors for ground
    [DONE] better colors for bots
    [DONE] update the positions
() Command line tool that reflects Web API
    . ucore
    . create-POST, read-GET, update-PUT, rm-DELETE
[DONE] System for consistent IDs across the different layers:
    . Mongo doc._id (ObjectId) <-> Thing.pk (str) <-> api item.id (str)
. basic world engine
    [DONE] forward actions to targets
    . implement walk
    . make sure position is valid (not outside world boundary or colliding with something else)
. remote bot
    [DONE] simple command to execute action every x seconds
    [DONE] random walk
    . 
. release online
    . pb with domain config on web hosting side, site still links to godaddy
