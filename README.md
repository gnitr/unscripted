# Unscripted

* Description: An open online universe for unscripted bots
* Primary Objective: encourage creation of artificial general intelligent agents (0 prior knowledge about world, no training data, general purpose, 100% algorithmically controlled)
* Version: Currently only a statement of intent
* Status: Quick experimental prototype

Potentially interesting aspects:
* experiments with unguided AI life evolution
* a safe sandbox for future real-world intelligences
* emergence of non-human controlled narratives
* stimulate philosophical, psychological and ethical questions
* playground for evolutionary, non-human behaviours
* emergent agent-agent communication
* virtual-world history
* study of agent-human interactions
* video game NPCs that are not dumb or predictable 

More details later.
